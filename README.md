    - We will respond as soon as possible.

  If you also tried this Google Codelab, or followed this workshop, please let us know your thoughts and suggestions. If you notice anything obsolete or wrong, you may raise an issue or send email to the author. :D

- You can create your first PWA by carefully following instructions in this README (or following the Codelab linked above) - Simple ! :)

  The pre requisites mentioned are recommended but not necessary for this demo app.

- This is not merely a copy paste of the Codelab :)

  Each step has been studied and executed carefully, adding in suggestions and recommendations where helpful

  This app is not meant to be a professional / production app. The purpose is to learn and try the essentials of PWA.

- Tip to those who embark on new learning / coding journeys
  
  Never give up, never, ever, ever! (No matter how many obstacles you face, keep going!)
  Tough times never last, but tough people do >:)
